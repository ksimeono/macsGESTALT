# macsGESTALT analysis notebooks

R Notebooks for macsGESTALT barcode quality control and clonal and subclonal reconstruction

* `clonal-processing.Rmd` goes through most of the workflow
* `make-alleles-files.Rmd` makes individual 'barcode-of-barcodes' allele files for each clone for downstream phylogenetic reconstruction using `TreeUtils` from https://github.com/mckennalab/SingleCellLineage/
* The `clonal-processing.nb.html` file for each mouse contains summary plots and running summary tables for different steps of the workflow
